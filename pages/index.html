            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vámonos de viaje</strong>
                    - Opens in a perfect way with a keyboard that reminds us of Ranma 1/2, when we have
                    nothing to worry about.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Súper V</strong>
                    - I know... she goes away, and with her, a part of us. Thanks for giving us one year
                    of therapy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>El Temblor</strong>
                    - Please don't agonize anymore. Everyone needs to stop for a moment, take a break; you
                    aren't a robot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Demasiado</strong>
                    - How many times have you found yourself in your corner, pondering when she allowed you
                    into her world? Perhaps it's time to discover a way out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>El club de la montaña</strong>
                    - Rummaging in a failed love, pushing forward and healing little by little, it doesn't
                    hurt anymore with this song.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hermanos</strong>
                    - Just let go, my friend. Close your eyes, lay back, and allow yourself to float along the
                    river of soft melodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tema de Susana</strong>
                    - Enough of sad songs. Get up and dance with the joy that our precious "Susana" bring us.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lento</strong>
                    - Have you stopped for a moment yet? What are you waiting for? Go at your own pace, fill
                    yourself with love; life is not a competition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tú Orbita</strong>
                    - Never rush things, everything must be done well and in due time; less is more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>El concierto</strong>
                    - All our wounds heal with a little help and willpower. It's never too late to start
                    again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ácido</strong>
                    - In the end, we always strive to love ourselves more, like an avalanche in the mountains,
                    on our journey, we become stronger.
                </li>
